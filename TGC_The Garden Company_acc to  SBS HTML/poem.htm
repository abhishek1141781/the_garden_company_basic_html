The Gardener
</h1>
<h4><i>by Robert Louis Stevenson</i></h4>
<p> 

</p>
<pre>The gardener does not love to talk,
He makes me keep the gravel walk;
And when he puts his tools away,
He locks the door and takes the key.
...
Well now, and while the summer stays,
To profit by these garden days,
O how much wiser you would be
To play at Indian wars with me!</pre>
<h4>Brief Biography from Answers.com:</h4>
<blockquote cite="http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-louis-stevenson">
<p>Stevenson was one of the most-read adventure novelists of the late
1800s. Among his most popular books were Kidnapped (1886), The Strange Case
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and Treasure Island (1883). The latter
book features Stevenson’s famous crafty pirate Long John Silver. Stevenson
also published a much-loved book of poems, A Child’s Garden of Verse
(1885). Having suffered from tuberculosis for much of his life, Stevenson
spent many years travelling in search of a climate that would suit his illness.
He finally settled in Samoa, where he died in 1894 and is buried.</p>
